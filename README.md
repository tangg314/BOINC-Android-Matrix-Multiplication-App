# BOINC-Android-Matrix-Multiplication-App
ICS 632: Principles of High Performance Computing

This was an individual project for ICS 632. An Android Matrix Multiplication app was developed using BOINC (open-sourced system that supports volunteer computing). The Android app was written in C and C++. A Debian BOINC server managed the Android application and distributed the input files to Android client smartphones located in Hawaii and Virginia. Experiments were conducted to answer the following challenges: (i)create a simple way for users to contribute to the project (ii)look at how a user’s location can affect their contribution to the project (iii)study how partitioning input files can affect a project’s efficiency. For the experiment results and more information, please refer to the Readme.pdf.
